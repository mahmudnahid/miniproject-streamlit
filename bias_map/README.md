## 🗺️ Bias map app

This repo gives the code for a Streamlit app that helps you discover whether language models (in this case DistilBert) are biased towards certain countries! 

Simply input a sentence which would countain a country name (using * as a country placeholder), and we will look at how the model predictions vary for all possible countries.
